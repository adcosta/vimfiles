 PERSONAL NOTES
 ==============

 I was using Vundle to manage my vim plugins. But recently changed to "Plug".
 Not really sure if it was a good move!...

 Plug commands:  :PlugClean  :PlugInstall :PlugUpgrade
 Vundle commands:    :PluginInstall :PluginSearch ...

 Plug has no search feature integrated and will never have. Author does not see
 it as a feature (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/issues/186)
